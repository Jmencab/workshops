Now that we've tested that we can hear an audio clip with the `fitMedia()` function, let's customize that audio clip! 

## Parameters  

You may have noticed that when you pasted the function, Earsketch produced some temporary text that you replaced with `fitMedia(YG_TRAP_ELECTRIC_PIANO_FILTERED_1, 3, 1, 17)`. This temporary text is also known as `parameters`. By updating these parameters, we can customize the sound we make!

Try changing the values of the following paramters to `fitMedia()`:

1. `fileName` - Navigate to the \'Sounds\' pane and find a sound
    you like.
2. `trackNumber` - Select any positive integer as the track number.
3. `startLocation/endLocation` - These parameters are quantified in measures. A measure is a segment of time which correlates to a specific number of beats.
